# Scientific Computing with Kubernetes

An upcoming tutorial at SC23.
To be presented by Mahidhar Tatineni and Dmitry Mishin.

## Overview

Kubernetes has become the leading container orchestration solution over the past few years. It can work anywhere from on-prem clusters to commercial clouds, abstracting the computational resources and workloads to run on those. In this tutorial the attendees will get an overview of the Kubernetes architecture, typical job and workflow submission procedures, learn how to use various storage options, and will learn how to run their software using Kubernetes. Theoretical information will be paired with hands-on sessions operating on the PNRP production Kubernetes cluster Nautilus.
